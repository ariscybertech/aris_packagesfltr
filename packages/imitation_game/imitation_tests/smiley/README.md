# Smiley

This test is an app that just draws one large image to the screen `smiley.png`,
stretched to fit inside the screen.

The following things are measured:

- 'ios_startup_time' - The time between the start of the process and the
  rendering of the image to the screen.
- 'adb_total_memory' - The amount of system memory the app is using after having
  rendered the image to the screen.
